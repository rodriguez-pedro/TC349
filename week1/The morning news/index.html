<li id="imgFloatLeft"><h3>PARIS, USA</h3>
<h2>Our French Connection</h2>
<h4>by Rosecrans Baldwin</h4>
<p>For some Americans, the French way of life is best. Other people simply prefer “freedom fries.” A two-week journey across the U.S.—passing through a handful of towns named Paris—to find out what Americans really think about France today. (Part three of four.)</p>

<li id="imgFloatLeft"><h3>A MODEST PROPOSAL</h3>
<h2>How to Not Kill a Cyclist</h2>
<h4>by Matthew Baldwin</h4>

<li id="imgFloatLeft"><h3>OTHER PEOPLE</h3>
<h2>Looking Back, Looking Forward</h2>
<h4>by Jonathan Bell</h4>
<p>Before the internet, before Facebook, before Twitter, a group of British documentary filmmakers launched what has become the grand-daddy of reality television. What can Seven Up! tell us about our own experiences in the (self-induced) spotlight?</p>
</li>

<li id="imgFloatLeft"><h3>ANNOUNCEMENTS</h3>
<h2>Like It’s 1999</h2>
<h4>by The Morning News</h4> 
<p>You may have noticed that one of our co-founders, Rosecrans Baldwin, has a new book out about his stint living and working in France, inspired by the letters he wrote for TMN.
On Tuesday, Rosecrans and Paul Ford will read at New York City’s KGB Bar at 7 p.m.. Rosecrans and Paul have an unlikely friendship, but we’re pretty sure this will be an event that TMN fans will not want to miss. Plus, there’s a party afterward. Continue Reading</p>

<h2>Arts and Crafts and Money</h2>
<h4>by Christopher R. Graham</h4>
<p>When “small batch” equals big dollars and one-person companies are supported by corporate-size websites, is “hand-made” what we think it is? A report from North America’s largest consumer craft fair, where the competition for puppet dollars is intense.</p>
</li>

<li id="imgFloatLeft"><h3>LETTERS FROM BEIRUT</h3>
<h2>Jonestown, Naipaul, and Me</h2>

<li id="imgFloatLeft"><h3>THIS WEEK</h3>
<h2>Everyone Is Wrong</h2>
<h4>by The Morning News</h4>
<p>Every Friday we take a look back at the week’s headlines, centering on a theme we’ve singled out as particularly important. This week, the opinion column’s wrath bled well beyond its confines with the headlines full of people calling others out, correcting them, and setting them straight.
Corrections to stories from the Middle East—e.g., “farewell sex”—that were too good last week to fact-check:
Blame it on journalists unfamiliar with their subject matter, the demands of an ever-quicker news cycle, or simply salacious stories that were “too good to check.”

<h2>Deplorable, Lousy, Godawful, and Required</h2>
<h4>by Leah Finnegan</h4>
<p>People complain that politics are worse than ever. It happens to be true. But history contains as many examples of the contentious, weird, and wacky as the present—and those absurdities are actually vital to our democracy.</p>
</li>

<li id="imgFloatLeft"><h3>CONTEST</h3>

<h2>Bagels, Toasted</h2>
<h4>by Martin Connelly</h4>

<li id="imgFloatLeft"><h3>THIS WEEK</h3>
<h2>There Is No Simple Answer</h2>
<h4>by The Morning News</h4>
<p>Every Friday we take a look back at the week’s headlines, centering on a theme we’ve singled out as particularly important. From the difficulties of dealing pot or having too much to read and learn, to being the biggest working comic without being famous, it’s never as easy as you think, and there’s rarely a simple answer to fix things. The headlines this week continued to remind us to shed conventional wisdom in favor of understanding the complexity of an issue.
Two takes on recent pan-African development:
