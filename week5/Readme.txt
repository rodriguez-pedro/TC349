Currently I only have time to finish one page.
It took me 3 hours to figure out how to have 
the subnavigation fixed at the top with screenspy running,
all while not screwing up the main nav bar. 
I just ran into too may dead ends to get this site how i wanted it.
However, I think it still meets the lab requirements as is.
