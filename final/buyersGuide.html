      <h2> CPU </h2>
      <p> Your CPU should be the first componenet you choose when building your PC. Outside of high-end gaming Pc's this will often be the most expensive component in your PC. It really SHOULD be this way. Many other components are easy to change out in the future, but this isn't so much the case with your CPU.</p>
      <h4> Intel vs. Amd </h4>
      <p> Certain pepople will tell you that one of these brands is simply better than the other. Honestly, this has never been the case. They both have competeitve products across different prices ranges. More recently AMD has dominated lower and mid-range CPU's for thier price, while Intel has offered very good high-end CPU for thier Price.
      </p>
      <h4> On-die CPU Graphics </h4>
      <p> Over the past 2 years, CPU manufacturer have been including powerful graphics chip on-die on certain models. Recent product lines , such as AMD's APU line (A-series processors) and Intel's Ivy Bridge (3rd Gen Core architecture). These newer models have completely negated the point of getting a sub-$80 graphics card, and are priced quite reasonably.  </p>
