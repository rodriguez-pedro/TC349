      <h2> CPU </h2>
      <p> Your CPU should be the first componenet you choose when building your PC. Outside of high-end gaming Pc's this will often be the most expensive component in your PC. It really SHOULD be this way. Many other components are easy to change out in the future, but this isn't so much the case with your CPU.</p>
      <h4> Intel vs. Amd </h4>
      <p> Certain pepople will tell you that one of these brands is simply better than the other. Honestly, this has never been the case. They both have competeitve products across different prices ranges. More recently AMD has dominated lower and mid-range CPU's for thier price, while Intel has offered very good high-end CPU for thier Price.
      </p>
      <h4> On-die CPU Graphics </h4>
      <p> Over the past 2 years, CPU manufacturer have been including powerful graphics chip on-die on certain models. Recent product lines , such as AMD's APU line (A-series processors) and Intel's Ivy Bridge (3rd Gen Core architecture). These newer models have completely negated the point of getting a sub-$80 graphics card, and are priced quite reasonably.  </p>
      
      <h2> Motherboard </h2>
      <p> Your motherboard is the main connector between all of you internal components. Your choice of motherboard is very closely tied to the CPU you choose, because motherboards have specific CPU socket types. The motherboard socket type must match your particular CPU. Outside of the CPU connection most other device connecters are standardized.</p>
      <p>Once you know the socket type you need, you must pick out what chipset you want on your board. A motherboard chipset defines what minimum set of component connections the motherboard can make. Also there are a few standard sizes of motherboards based on the given chipset (ATX,  mATX, mini-ITX) Chipsets are usually defined by CPU manufactures. For any given CPU you pick out there is usually anywhere from 3-5 chipset you can choose from. </p>
<p> There are many manufactures of motherboards. Similar chipset boards will be VERY similar between manufactures, and thus quite easy to compare. Over there years I have learned that there is a difference among manufacture when it comes to build quality. I’ve leaned to trust Gigabyte, Asus, Msi, and Evga as great motherboard manufactures. </p>

<h2>Graphics Card </h2>
<p>This one component is the only real difference among gaming/everyday/ and workstation computers.  Typically in everyday computers there will be no additional graphics card beyond what is built into the CPU. Occasionally you would see some sub-$100 graphics card in them, but rarely are they necessary. </p>
<p> If you find that you do need a little graphics power for gaming or for other visually intensive programs, a good starting point for a dedicated graphics card is a Radeon 5670/6670 or a NVidia 540. Both of these cards require no external power (so no need to upgrade your power supply), and cost around $80.</p>
<p> If you are building a computer from scratch it would be worth the $20 extra dollars over these two options to pick up a Radeon 6770 or a NVidia 460. These two card offer Amazing performance for their given price. In the Gaming realm, either one of these card would be able to run any modern game at a 900p resolution. These cards are a great starting point for gaming computers currently.</p>
<p> There are plenty of great site to find current info out there about higher end models, but just a quick list of model good for their price right now would be Radeon 6870 Radeon 7850 Radeon7970 NVidia 670.  Here is a link to a great recent article on gaming graphics cards <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html"> link </a></p>

<h2> Power supplies </h2>
<p>Power supplies (or PSU/ Power Supply Unit) can be one of the difficult things to pick out. At a base level you must pick out a PSU that will provide enough power to all of you components. This can be anywhere from 250Watts to over 1000watts. There is a great online calculator that can be found<a href="http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalculatorlite.jsp"> here</a> to help you determine the required wattage for you system. Many people often don’t look beyond the wattage when buying a power supply, however I feel this is a mistake. Power supplies come in MANY varying qualities. PSU’s took me longer than any other component to really learn how to judge the quality of.  JonnyGuru.com is a great start to leaning more about Power supplies, as I feel they have the best/most comprehensive reviews out there on power supplies. </p>
