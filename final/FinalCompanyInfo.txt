   My fictitious company will be in the business of making custom desktop pc’s.
Many companies exist out there, and they tend to be mainly focused on online sales.
I would want to sell not only pre-built machines, but parts as well. 

   How I wish to stand out from the rest is to include tutorials for D.I.Y. PC builders.
These tutorials would cover: picking out proper components for you specific budget,
putting the P.C. together, to more advance topics like hooking up water cooling systems and over-clocking.
The overall goal of the site would be to create a well designed shop, 
and to include and incorporate in-depth knowledge about the products we are selling.
